# ParseMe

### You need an appointment from IND? 
Here is an simple function to help getting you notified in moment new slots open.
Function uses predefined configuration for your **email address** to be notified and **max days** you're willing to wait for the appointment.
This is just a version 1 and will be back in short with new features as follows :
## Road map of Version 2
- Multiple records will be persisted in NoSql DB ( Let's make it cheap. Azure Table Storage it is)
- Records will be managed with a authenticated(federated) frontend (ParseMe Portal) ( Over engineering isn't what we are looking for. It'll be so simple. So, Vanilla JS it's)
- Multiple record checks on every function run
- Expiration check for records and email quota

### ParseMe Portal features will be certain after a while
